# Tree 

A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that,there is a specially designated node called a root. The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets t1,t2,...tn where each of these sets is a tree.


## Basic Terminologies

1. **Node**:

A Tree is a collection of entities called nodes.Nodes are connected by edges. Each node contain a value or data associated with it. First node of the tree is called **root**


2. **Leaf Node**

Nodes without child nodes are called leaf nodes

3. **Parent Node**

The node which is the predeccesor of a node is called parent node of that node.

4. **Child Node**

The node which is the successor of a node is called child of that node.

1. **Degree**

The degree of a node is the number of subtrees of the node.

6. **Siblings**

Children of the same parent are called siblings

7. **Level of a node**

It is the number of edges on the path from root node to 'n'

8. **Height of a node**

It is the number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf node.

9. **Depth of a node**

Length of the path from root to that node.
